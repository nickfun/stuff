# Misc Programming Stuff

Hello I'm nick and this is my `stuff` folder.

## What do I use this for?

* Learning new languages
* Trying out ideas
* Understanding concepts
* Refreshing my memory on the fundamentals

It's important for a modern programmer to know a _lot_ of things. This is my playground where I try to keep up with
a fast moving industry.

## What have I learned so far?

* Groovy is pretty neat
* RabbitMQ is simple and the official tutorials are good
* It is easy to forget the basics
* The docs for Snake Yaml are not the best
* Static Typed Java is great at work for big projects but not easy to get something going quick
* Picking a language and sticking to it is very difficult. There are so many tools and libraries for todays languages that I can't keep my excitement to just one.
